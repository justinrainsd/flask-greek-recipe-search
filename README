Flask application that serves as a Greek Recipe Dictionary. This was made using Python - Flask, HTML, and CSS.

Future Updates
- Search Functionality using java to create the search query
- Images for the individual recipes


Improvements to be made
- Due to the website structure the scraped data was pulled from, there will need to be an effort to go back and re-pull the data so that
ingredients and steps can be better defined
